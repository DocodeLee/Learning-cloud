For the whole day i spent to learn kali linux.
Firt They cannot find the filename, and even i couldn't run virtual box.
I don't have enough space so i clear some files.
But there was no iso image even i download the full file. and i release
The problem was simple just download

Let me dive into Linux

This is the first access to kali
## Binary: files that can be executed
## Case sensitivity 
## Directory -Folder
## Home : their own /home directory
## Shell This is an environment and interpreter for running commands in Linux.
Linux has many different shell environments, the most popular is the bash shell,

## File system in linux
 Linux doesnâ€™t have a physical drive (such as the C: drive) at the base of the filesystem but uses a logical filesystem instead.

### pwd: finding yourself
### whoami checking login
### cd: change the directories
### ls -1 provides us with significantly more information, such as whether an object is a file or directory, the number of links, the owner, the group, its size, when it was created or modified, and its name.
### ls -la shows hidden file
## Getting help
>aircrack-ng --help
>nmap -h
## most commands and applications have a manual (man) page with more information
## Searching with locate
Use the locate buut locate command is not perfect
## If you are finding Binary file you can use whereis command
## which command is even more specific: it only returns the location of the binaries in the patH variable
## FIND
### find / -type f -name apache2
It browse every file so it takes time. so if you can specify the file can save the tiem (/etc /bin ....)
## Filtering with grep
###  grep command is often used when output is piped from one command to another.
Linux (and Windows for that matter) allows us to take the output of one command and send it as input to another command.
we use the | command to do it
 ps command is used to display information about processes running on the machine.

I found that the root was the problem

### When you use the cat command after you finish the input ctrl + D will be reform the commnad line
### CAT vs TOUCH
Touch command is used to create a new empty file without preview and also used to update a time and date stamp of a file which is already exist. And the cat command is used to create a new single or multiple file with preview and also used to dump(view) file data in a terminal.
## Creating Directory
### Directory is folder you can save file in directory

when you copy to file to other place use cp filename root(~/newdirectory)
## Renaming the name
In linux there is no command for rename for this you need to use move command. $move original-name new-name
## Removing
rm is for file rmdir is for directory
but you cannot remove the directory which is not empty/ if you delete the all the content. rm -r command will help to delete the directory
## network intrusion detection system
